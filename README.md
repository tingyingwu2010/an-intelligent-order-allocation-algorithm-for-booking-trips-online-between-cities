# an-intelligent-order-allocation-algorithm-for-booking-trips-online-between-cities
   In order to solve the actual vehicle routing problem, an intelligent order allocation algorithm for booking trips online between cities is proposed. The algorithm uses the time and space information of the order to construct the initial order allocation scheme set, then uses local search to optimize the order allocation scheme, and dynamically allocates the new orders according to the appointment time, and finally provides different order allocation schemes for decision makers. By constructing the order allocation scheme and optimizing the order allocation scheme, the algorithm can obtain high-quality solutions in a short time.
